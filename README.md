# STUDENTS-SOCIO-ECONONMIC-DATA-ANALYSIS
## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze socio-economic factors affecting students at GSFC University. By studying these factors, we can identify trends, correlations, and key insights to help improve students' overall well-being and academic performance. The analysis leverages Python, Streamlit, and various data visualization and machine learning libraries.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize data, and encode categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize socio-economic trends using interactive charts.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identify relationships between socio-economic factors and academic performance.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Use machine learning models to predict outcomes like higher education interest.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built with Streamlit to provide an easy-to-use interface for exploring the data.
